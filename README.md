# ReunificationForm
This is a Survey123 "Smart Form" for reunification information. This can be used for tracking status of: 
- Missing Persons
- Survivors in need of Rescue/Evacuation
- Survivors Rescued/Evacuated
- Human Remains

The goal of this form is support wide area search operations when detailed information is needed to support reunification, beyond SARCOP Waypoints. It must be hosted on platforms approved for handling personally identifiable information (PII).

The webform based prototype can be found here https://arcg.is/iDC01 and CANNOT BE USED OR REAL-WORLD INCIDENTS.

Once it is ready we will release an XLSForm for download or ArcGIS Survey123 Template for re-hosting.
